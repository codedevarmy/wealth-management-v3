We all like to think our investment choices are logical—but our minds often play tricks on us. Behavioural biases are psychological tendencies that can lead to poor financial decisions without us realizing it. To succeed in long-term investing, especially with mutual funds, recognizing and managing these biases is essential.

## Common Investing Biases

- Thinking you know more than you do can lead to excessive risk-taking or holding onto bad investments.
- We prefer information that supports our views, ignoring facts that challenge them.
- The pain of loss often outweighs the joy of gain, leading to irrational decisions like refusing to exit a poor investment.
- Following the crowd, especially during market highs or lows, often results in poor timing.
- Sticking to initial impressions, even when the market reality has changed.

## How to Overcome Them

- Recognize that everyone, including you, is vulnerable to bias.
- Avoid emotional decision-making during market swings.
- A trusted financial advisor can bring in objective, professional insight.
- Use SIPs and a clear investment strategy to stay disciplined, even in volatile markets.

Behavioural biases are human—but by being conscious of them and investing with discipline, you can avoid common pitfalls and make smarter, more consistent decisions.
