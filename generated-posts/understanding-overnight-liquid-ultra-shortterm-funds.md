Looking to park surplus cash or optimize short-term returns? Three key mutual fund categories— **overnight funds, liquid funds, and ultra short-term funds**—offer varied levels of liquidity, safety, and return potential. Here's how they differ:

## 1. Overnight Funds: For Maximum Safety & Liquidity

- **What it is:** Invests in one-day maturity instruments like repos and CBLOs.
- **Risk/Return:** Minimal risk, but lowest returns.
- **Best for:** Ultra-short parking of funds (1–2 days), with next-day liquidity.

## 2. Liquid Funds: The Emergency Fund Favourite

- **What it is:** Invests in debt and money market instruments maturing in up to 91 days.
- **Risk/Return:** Low risk with steady, slightly better returns than savings accounts.
- **Best for:** Parking money for a few days to 3 months—ideal for emergency corpus or upcoming expenses.

## 3. Ultra Short-Term Funds: The Balanced Pick

- **What it is:** Invests in instruments maturing in 3–12 months.
- **Risk/Return:** Slightly higher risk and return than liquid funds.
- **Best for:** Investors with a 3–12 month horizon looking for a better yield than traditional short-term options.

## Quick Comparison:

| Fund Type        | Risk     | Liquidity          | Return Potential | Suitable For                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Overnight Fund   | Very Low | Next-day           | Low              | 1–2 day parking               |
| Liquid Fund      | Low      | Within 24 hrs      | Moderate         | Short-term needs (1–3 months) |
| Ultra Short-Term | Moderate | Few days to a week | Higher           | 3–12 month goals              |

## Bottom Line

Match your fund choice with your investment horizon and risk tolerance. For safety and quick access—go with **overnight or liquid funds**. If you're willing to stretch your timeline for higher returns, **ultra short-term funds** may be ideal.

As always, consult a financial advisor to build a short-term strategy that fits your unique needs.
