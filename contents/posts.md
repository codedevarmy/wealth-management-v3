## Don't Panic Sell

The market is a rollercoaster, and a drop in prices can make anyone anxious. The biggest mistake you can make is to **panic sell** your investments when the market dips. This turns a temporary, paper loss into a permanent, real loss. Remember, investing is a marathon, not a sprint. If you've invested in solid companies or funds, give them time to recover. A market downturn is often a great opportunity for long-term investors to buy more at a lower price.

## Avoid Herd Mentality

Ever heard the phrase, "don't follow the herd"? It's especially true in investing. Seeing everyone around you buying a 'hot' stock or fund can create a sense of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). But investing based on tips from friends or social media is a recipe for disaster. The smartest investors do their own research and analysis. If you don't understand an investment, don't put your money in it.

## Over-diversification

While diversification is crucial, you can have too much of a good thing. Spreading your money across dozens of different mutual funds or stocks can be counterproductive. It makes your portfolio difficult to track and can dilute your returns, essentially turning your portfolio into a mirror of the market itself. A handful of well-chosen, non-overlapping funds is often more effective.

## Not Reviewing Your Portfolio

Once you've made an investment, don't just forget about it. Your financial goals, risk appetite, and market conditions can change over time. It's essential to review your portfolio regularly—at least once a year. This helps you rebalance your asset allocation, get rid of underperforming assets, and ensure your investments are still aligned with your long-term goals.

## Investing Without a Goal

This is like driving without a destination. Before you invest a single rupee, you need to know why you are investing. Is it for your child's education, retirement, or buying a house? Your goal will determine your investment horizon and your risk tolerance. An investor saving for retirement in 20 years can take more risk than someone saving for a down payment next year.

## Chasing Past Performance

Just because a stock or a mutual fund did well last year doesn't mean it will do the same this year. Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. Many new investors fall into this trap, only to find that the fund's luck has run out. Instead of looking in the rearview mirror, focus on the fundamentals and the future potential of an investment.

## Ignoring Inflation

Inflation is the silent killer of returns. Leaving your money in a savings account might feel safe, but if the interest rate is lower than the inflation rate, you're actually losing money in real terms. Over time, your money's purchasing power gets eroded. To combat this, you must invest in assets like equities and real estate that have the potential to give inflation-beating returns.
